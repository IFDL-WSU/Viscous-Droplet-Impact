# Image-Processing
This section of the project revolves arround making and understanding the functions for Image-Processing in matlab. 

## Goals
  By 10/03/2020: Function that takes video input and outputs frame-by-frame  <br /> 
  By 10/10/2020: Function that processes frames and outputs frames with boundary layers  <br /> 
  By 10/17/2020: Overlay axes and create a function that outputs center of gravity for boundary layer images  <br /> 
  By 10/24/2020: Function that takes center of gravity, axis, and boundary layer input and outputs velocity and max spread radius <br /> 
  By 11/14/2020: Final app that takes video file input and outputs video frame-by-frame with boundary outlined along with velocity, max spread radius, jet formation, droplet break-up, and partial rebound data
